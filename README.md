# Art Of It All - v2.0
This is a recreation of one of my previous projects. 
The idea of this is displaying art from different artists for sale. 
Also, allowing customers to make personal requests for pieces of art they would like made. 
The site would also be an opportunity to help the artist get a foothold in the industry, 
for exposure and learning how to handle these types of situations before doing it on their own. 
The interaction I want for this are:-

* I'd like to have a market bag to show all products
* I'd like users, artist and the owner to be able to sign in to the page
* I'd like to send emails at specific times, after registration and check out
